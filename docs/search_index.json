Most of them are obvious if you think about them. You should also know the formula or other calculation procedures for these. These will be presented using the $ format and some commonly used sample data sets. The na.rm option is included because you are always safer using it. 2.1 These are from core R That means the base and stats packages. # Mean mean(chickwts$weight, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 261.3099 # Variance (for a sample) var(chickwts$weight, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 6095.503 # Variance (for a population) # There is no simple function for this. The code below shows one possible way # The length() function gives you the total rows and na.omit() ensures that you # are not counting NAs, since they are not in the calculation of var(). var(chickwts$weight, na.rm = TRUE)* (length(na.omit(chickwts$weight)) - 1)/ length(chickwts$weight) ## [1] 6009.65 # Standard deviation (for a sample) sd(chickwts$weight, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 78.0737 # Note there is no simple conversion from sample standard deviation # to population standard deviation. # Calculate the population variance and take the square root. See the next # section. # Median median(chickwts$weight, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 258 # Quantiles (you specify which ones you want) quantile(chickwts$weight, probs = c(.25, .50, .75), na.rm = TRUE) ## 25% 50% 75% ## 204.5 258.0 323.5 # Minimum min(chickwts$weight, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 108 # Maximum max(chickwts$weight, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 423 # Table # This is normally used for factor variables table(chickwts$feed, useNA = &quot;ifany&quot;) ## ## casein horsebean linseed meatmeal soybean sunflower ## 12 10 12 11 14 12 Also you should know that the summary() function can be used on almost object and will give you results depending on what that object is. summary(chickwts) ## weight feed ## Min. :108.0 casein :12 ## 1st Qu.:204.5 horsebean:10 ## Median :258.0 linseed :12 ## Mean :261.3 meatmeal :11 ## 3rd Qu.:323.5 soybean :14 ## Max. :423.0 sunflower:12 summary(chickwts$weight) ## Min. 1st Qu.

You should memorize these. 3.1 Assignment operator &lt;- This is used to assign the value of whatever is on the right to the object on the left. a &lt;- 4 Means that a is now 4. b &lt;- chickwts Means that b is now a data frame with all the data from chickwts. 3.2 Combine function c() This essential function lets you put a set of values into a vector. a &lt;- c(2, 3, 4, 5) b &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) c &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE) Now a, b, and c refer to these sets of values. 3.3 Pipe operator This is not part of the core of R, but it is widely used. It comes from the magrittr package. %&gt;% The way it works is that everything on the left becomes an input to what is done on the right. This is supposed to be more like natural writing. First do this, then do this, then do this. The code below says: take the chickwts data, group the rows by the feed variable, then get the mean weight for each of the feed types. library(magrittr) chickwts %&gt;% dplyr::group_by(feed) %&gt;% dplyr::summarize( mean=mean(weight)) ## # A tibble: 6 x 2 ## feed mean ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 casein 324. ## 2 horsebean 160. ## 3 linseed 219. ## 4 meatmeal 277. ## 5 soybean 246. ## 6 sunflower 329.

For example you may want to identify everyone 18 or over but who are also 65 or under. For these we use the logical operators. The first set of examples are very simple. Name Operator Meaning Example Result OR | At least one statement is true 7 == 6+1 | 7 == 8-1 TRUE OR | At least one statement is true 7 == 6+1 | 7 == 8+1 TRUE Exclusive OR xor(x,y) Exactly one statement is true xor(7 == 6+1, 7 == 8-1) FALSE Exclusive OR xor(x,y) Exactly one statement is true xor(7 == 6+1, 7 == 8+1) TRUE AND &amp; All statements are true 7 == 6+1 &amp; 7 == 8-1 TRUE AND &amp; All statements are true 7 == 6+1 &amp; 7 == 8+1 FALSE If you know any other computer languages be aware that | and &amp; and || and &amp;&amp; work differently in R than you might expect.

["statistics-for-multiple-variables.html", "Chapter 5 Statistics for Multiple Variables 5.1 Using formula notation 5.2 Using group_by", " Chapter 5 Statistics for Multiple Variables Most of the time we want to look at the relationship between two or more variables. R has several different ways of working with multiple variables. 5.1 Using formula notation In R a “forumula” is created using the ~ operator, which is found on the top left of the keyboard. In these examples the formula operator always works like this: dependent_variable ~ independent_variable and if you have multiple independent_variables use a + to add them on the right. Crosstab using lehmansociology lehmansociology::crosstab(tension ~ wool, data = warpbreaks) ## tension ~ wool ## A B ## L 9 9 ## M 9 9 ## H 9 9 ## Total N 27 27 Ordinary Linear Model (This means it has an interval dependent variable.) lm(raises ~ critical, data = attitude) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = raises ~ critical, data = attitude) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) critical ## 35.025 0.396 Generalized Linear Model (In this case a logistic regression.)

["graphs.html", "Chapter 6 Graphs 6.1 How ggplot works 6.2 Common problems", " Chapter 6 Graphs In our classes we primarily use the ggplot2 package for graphing. Remember that you will need to load the package library(ggplot2). As a package is is very flexible and provides many options that will let you do just about any visualization, but this can make it seem complicated when you are starting out learning it. 6.1 How ggplot works Ggplot constructs a graph by building it up piece by piece, with the parts connected with + signs. 6.1.1 ggplot() A ggplot always starts with the ggplot() function. This provides the name of the data set and sets up the background of your graph. Next one or more aes() functions define the x variable and the y variable (if needed). Notice how the three axes below differ depending on how many variables there are and what kind of variable they are. The aes() which is short for aesthetics. library(ggplot2) ggplot(iris) ggplot(iris) + aes(x = Sepal.Length) ggplot(iris) + aes(x = Sepal.Length) + aes(y = Sepal.Width) ggplot(iris) + aes(x = Species) + aes( y = Sepal.Width) 6.1.2 Adding geom To add data to the axes you use a “geom” that determines the type of display. The geom does not modify the axis, it adds data to it. To show this, let’s save the ggplot information and add to it. Our first example is only for one variable. Often, you will want to add options such as binwidth. The last example shows how to use a slightly different approach to graph the cumulative distribution (ecdf). graph1 &lt;- ggplot(iris) + aes(x = Sepal.Length) graph1 + geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. graph1 + geom_dotplot(binwidth = .1) graph1 + geom_bar() graph1 + geom_density() graph1 + stat_ecdf(geom = &quot;step&quot;) Our second example uses two interval variables, so has different possibilities than the first. The second one shows one way that geoms can be combined. graph2 &lt;- ggplot(iris) + aes(x = Sepal.Length) + aes(y = Sepal.Width) graph2 + geom_point() graph2 + geom_point() + geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; graph2_with_species &lt;- ggplot(iris) + aes(x = Sepal.Length) + aes(y = Sepal.Width) + aes(color = Species) + geom_point() graph2_with_species This data includes two types of data. The last example shows how multiple geoms can be combined. graph3 &lt;- ggplot(iris) + aes(x = Species) + aes(y = Sepal.Width) graph3 + geom_point() graph3 + geom_count() graph3 + geom_jitter() graph3 + geom_boxplot() graph3 + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter() 6.1.3 Add titles and labels, modify axes There are many additional options that you can use. This document will just show how to add a title and labels and modify axes. graph3 + geom_jitter() + ggtitle(&quot;Sepal Width by Species in the Iris Data&quot;) + labs(y=&quot;Sepal Width&quot;, x=&quot;Iris Species&quot;) The way to modify axes is to use scale_y_continuous and scale_x_continuous. These are very flexible and have many options. This section will show how to change or improve some of the previous plots. # Remove irrelevant y axis values graph1 + geom_dotplot(binwidth = .1) + scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) # Use the same tick marks on the x axis match those on the y axis graph2 + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous( breaks = seq(4, 8, .5), minor_breaks = waiver()) There are several websites that give detailed examples of more complex ways to create visualizations. 6.2 Common problems Some of the most common problems in ggplot are the same as any other code in R, misspelling names, using the wrong graph for your data type, or having a problem with your tick marks. Here are some errors that you are most likely to see when using ggplot. 6.2.1 unexpected symbol This happens when you forget to put a + between the different parts of your plot. graph3 geom_jitter() Error: unexpected symbol in &quot;graph3 geom_jitter&quot; 6.2.2 invalid argument to unary operator This happens if you have an extra +. graph3 + + geom_jitter() Error in +geom_jitter() : invalid argument to unary operator 6.2.3 Error: unexpected ‘)’ This happens if you have an extra closing parenthesis. graph2 &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))) Error: unexpected &#39;)&#39; in &quot;graph2 &lt;- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)))&quot; "],
